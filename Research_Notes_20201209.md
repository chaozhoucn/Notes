#### Cash Holdings

##### Bates, Kahle & Stulz, 2009, The Journal of Finance, Why Do U.S. Firms Hold So Much More Cash than They Used To? 

4 motives for firms to hold cash: 

```markdown
1. transaction motive / economies of scale / large firms hold less cash / transaction costs associated with converting a noncash financial asset into cash and uses cash for payments
2. precuationary motive / better cope with adverse shocks
3. tax motive repatriate funds to domestic from foreign subidiaries
4. agency motive
```

Data section: 

* merged CRSP / Compustat files 
* 1980 to 2006
* including surviving and nonsurviving firms
* positive assets in a given year
* positive sales in a given year
* exclude financial firms SIC 6000 to 6999 / capital requirement / ~~not for economic business~~
* exclude utilities SIC 4900 to 4999 / regulatory requirement

How to measure: 

* cash ratio as cash and marketable securities divided by total assets

#### KZ Index

##### Hadlock & Pierce 2009, Review of financial studies, New Evidence on Measuring Financial Constraints: Moving Beyond the KZ Index. 

###### few concepts: 

1. KZ index & WW index are to study financial constraints. 

2. KZ index firstly advocated by Kaplan and Zingales (1997)

3. original KZ index: Lamont, Polk & Saa-Requejo (2001)

4. qualitative information to intepreted company's financial constraints 

   > by reading statements made by managers in SEC filings from 1995 to 2004.
   >
   > > **is this the right way to do KZ index? ** 

5. direct approach to categorizing financial constraints is ***not*** paractical for **large samples**

   >  is this applicable for the long period data such as **1965 to 2019** and **all the firms** ? 

###### evaluate KZ index: 

1. positively on leverage and Q
2. negatively on cash flow, cash levels and dividends
3. calculated KZ index for entire Compustat universe to ~~compare~~ the coefficient of their models, correlation of these two are 0. `it would appear that researchers should apply extreme caution when using the traditional KZ index or interpreting results based on index sorts`

##### Steven N.Kaplan and Luigi Zingales, 1997,  *The Quarterly Journal of Economics*

Does investment-cash flow sensitivities provide useful measusres of financing constraints. 

###### Data measures: 

1. determine the availability of and the demand for funds for each of the sample firms

2. examine each firm's annual report or 10-K

   > 10-K is a comprehensive report filed annually by a publicly-traded company about its financial performance and is require by the SEC. 

3. firm-year classifications

4. over seven - or eight year subperiods

5. and over the entire sample period
