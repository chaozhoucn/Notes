因为Johnson & Rice的文章是从1994年到2005年，那么2005年之后的数据是延续2005年的数据，还是另外有变化？

[page 89]

IBBEA 允许自1995年9月29日之后的州际银行acquisitions，同时废止了1956年的Douglas Amendment Bank Holding Company Act.

> Unlike the interstate branching provisions discussed below, the states were not permitted to opt out of the interstate banking rules.

此处是否可以回答篇首的问题，在2005年之后，银行也会一直遵照IBBEA法案的规定，也就是会延续2005年的数据？

IBBEA does impose certain federal level restrictions on interstate banking. 

1. The bank holding company acquiring the bank must be "adequately capitalized" and  "adequately managed". 
2. The bank holding company after the acquistition may not exceed a nationawide deposit concentration limitation of 10 percent of total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States. 州内存款不能超过10%？
3. The bank holding company may not exceed a statewide deposit concentration limitation, after the acquistion, of 30%. 当银行控股公司完成了acquisition之后，存款集中度不能超过30%？

同时IBBEA还有关于reinvestment laws, antitrust laws, state age laws等等的要求，以及税务方面的要求。

Although IBBEA was intended to apply to all states, it did permit a state to prohibit "expressly" all "merger transacations involving out-of-state banks", effectively preventing interstate banking for that state. This was commonly referred to as a bank's ability to "opt out of interstate branching. 

The only requirements were that

(1) a state had to opt out of interstate branching after the the enactment date of IBBEA and before June 1, 1997, and 如果一个州选择推出不参与这项法则，则应该在1994年9月29日之后和1997年6月1号之前选择不参与这项法则。

(2) it had to apply "equally to all out-of-state banks". 选择退出了之后则应该适用于所有州外银行。

`Texas and Montana` 选择退出了，但是在之后又重新拥护了IBBEA法则。

IBBEA gave states the ability to set regulations on interstate branching with regard to four important provisions: 

> 1. the minimum age of the target institution to be acquired an then merged into the acquirer
> 2. de novo interstate branching
> 3. acquisition of individual branches, and 
> 4. statewide deposit cap. 

之后是分开介绍**四项重要州立条款**

#### Minimum age of target institution

The state law, however, cannot impose an age requirement of more than `five` years. Many states set `their` age requirement at five years, but several states implemented a lower state age requirement (such as `three` years) or required no minimum age limit at all. 

> it protects older and established banks in the state.
>
> it imposes significant costs on out-of-state entry. 

#### DE novo interstate branching

de novo interstate branching is only permitted under IBBEA if a state `explicitly` opts in to this provision, that is, a bank is allowed to open an interstate branch only if state law expressly permits it to do so. 

但是这项条款仅仅适用于控股银行公司第一次进入该州。

#### Acquisition of single branches or other portions of an institution

这项条款适用于`states must explicitly opt in to this provision`

允许银行控股公司单独获得一个分支机构或者一些分支机构，但是这些分支机构所在的州必须要准许这项条款。

#### Statewide deposit cap

如果被收购方控制了30%或者更多的州内存款，那么收购方将不允许收购该被收购方。

The obvious impact of a deposit concentration limitation would be to prevent a bank from entering into a larger interstate merger in such a state. For example, if a state had set a deposit cap of 15%, a bank could `not` enter into an interstate merger transaction with any institution that held more than 15% of the deposits in that particular state. 

**存款上限越高，收购的难度越小？**
